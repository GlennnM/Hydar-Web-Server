# Hydar-Chat-Website
An experimental social media

The website provides boards for groups of people to use both text and voice communication.
There is also functionality for users to browse the site anonymously.
Users can be invited to boards and create their own boards to invite others.

We use a custom jsp compiler and limit external library usage.
